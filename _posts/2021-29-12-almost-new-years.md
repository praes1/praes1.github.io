## dear becki, 

hey becki!!! i hope you read this, and that you see this. christmas for me was okay, i got a nice fossil watch, i think that you would probably really like it if you ever see me wear it.
my whole family came and stuff and we just talked, and it was a good time. my dad, when he got his gift, said something along the lines of la boberia esta, which made me really angry, after opening the gift my mom gave him. that made me really angry. i dont really know why im telling you this, but it was just a memorable moment for me. 
i had a good time with you, going out. i want to do it again, maybe for longer this time, so that we can get more comfortable and just have more time. you probably know this already, but if you ever want to, i can come and pick you up so that you dont get in trouble. you have nothing to worry about me getting in trouble, im pretty confident. 
 please tell me about how that encounter went between you and your dad, hearing stories of how you talk about your dad always makes me laugh hella. i know right now youre probably going fucking crazy painting in your little studio, having a good ass time all cooped up in there. i hope you did something with my ideas that i gave you in your poll, maybe they werent that good,  but maybe you used another bf's idea instead. new years is coming up!!!
probably for new years ill go to my uncles house and do the same thing we did hear for christmas. i really wonder what youre going to be up to, i really hope you dont just stay home
painting. my mom told me today that for march, were going to go to madrid, and the south of spain, sevilla, cordoba, andalusia. i really wonder what you were thinking the entire time 
you were there with me, or just what you were feeling or something about that night. i for one, loved it. i wasnt faking absolutely nothing. i think about it all the time. these days, i feel like i havent gone out of the house in months. now, aside from coding,
im starting to watch netflix shows, and im starting with black mirror, just because from what youve told me i think i would like it. if you have any other reccomendations, im all ears. 
eliecer is starting to talk with me less now i notice, partly because i know that hes starting to get really attached to jaden. her parents, and her, are completely trump supporters. when eliecer told me that, i thought that was so funny, considering the fact that eliecer is literally illegal. 
you know, that after all this time, he still talks to me about natalie, and how he kind of misses her still. i wish sometimes that i could send you little posts or something on instagram, sometimes i do, but i unsend them after. they gave me 300 dollars to spend on whatever i want in the bookstore in UF! i dont even know what im gonna get yet, i dont even think i need any textbooks or anything like that. 
maybe ill buy like a bluetooth mouse or something for my computer, or some shit i dont even know thats still fucking crazy to me, i dont even know why they gave me that, but the last thing youll see me doing is complaining. anyways, when you see this, write me back, and i wont stop bugging you about those fucking letters you owe me untill one day i see them in my mailbox!!!!


love,
