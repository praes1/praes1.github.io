hello i love this  i think this coding website is super 

neat i hope everything comes out good.

Anyways i have so many things and moments i have had where 

i knew i wanted to write it and tell you but either 

crumpled my letter or got it in a return. 

on thanksgiving i started going crazy. writing you things

but i was so manic i just threw them out i feel 

like i go into a space i shouldn't even be welcoming

you in i just get sad? i didn't do anything for thanksgiving i 

was home alone while my family went to my uncles. I don't really 

want to go on vacations anymore and i don't want 

to go to the one in match.

I feel like nobody else in my family even talks to

me or calls me or even knows me i didn't feel like going

i just painted whatever i thought of. i have been able

to paint something i like in such a long time

i've bought multiple canvases even larger then me 

but still can't think of anything 

i get really sad sometimes and start doing things

to hurt myself on purpose i don't know why i've

been like thag 

while i was at work someone vandilized my car popped two

of my tires tore my mirror and took the mirror with them

and pulled off my bumper. Chilis had no cameras 

i had to file a police report. argue with my dad

for hours even tho it wasn't my fault i had no

idea who did it or why or anything like that

i paid 500 for the deductible and 500 to toyota for fixing 

police report couldn't find anything and they 

weâ€™re too lazy to send the finger prints on my car saying

excuses like they probably wouldn't show up clear

anyways. I have to pay my own school in like 2 days

i feel like all i do it woek all i think about all

the time

is more money and how bad i want it just like

3000 idk i applied for like a million grants and scholarships

my teacher is helping me model for this shoe company

he said my vive matches it perfectly and he's tje 

photographer for it and i already have some nikes

that they like, but i have to take headshots

i told them no i don't like pictures i my self they'll let

me do it without my face . 

I haven't taken a picture of myself or felt like me in so

long Idk what's happening to me i'm sorry everything

is always so sad. but at the same time i think my 

creativity and best thoughts come from when i'm sad 

and the story lines i write down to create a painting for them

are when im the most sad.  i like making sad stories behind my 

drawings, my mom doesn't though. She always tellis me not to go

with my original idea and gives me a better story or something

happier. I wish  i had another job that gave more money

quicker i hate going to two different

jobs and feeling like either or i'm making the same

for everything i have to pay

i never been worse w my dad honestly i have nothing with him

and he hates me it's horrible i hate it

i just want to move and leave 

I lost my punk 57 book somewhere and i was on the last chaotwr

wirj my favorite book mark.  i haven't found it una. while.

i think about you a lot. i think it makes me so depressed and 

sad to think about you or look through things of you and social 

media i don't know why but it instantly makes me cry when 

i read how u write bout me i feel like i have no idea

who that is and you don't really even know me or like me

it's like i don't know how you are even expressing this love

or affection for someone and me idk i can't imagine you really sitting don

and wondering what i'm doing and what im feeling enough

to send me a letter. One day , my teacher tried being nice 

wirj me one day i was upset. i told him i didn't have any ideas

for my drawing and keot being on my phone bc i didn't take pictures 

of my set up i had forgot

i asked if i could go home bc i didn't have my picture so what would 

i work on

this was the first day after the hole police thing , he tells me no i can't leave

and then he tells me make a piece of an ex boyfriend and make it on freedom or what

you have gained from a past relationship and for some reason i got so triggered

i was giving so much attitude and i told him there's no reason of me being here

being a toto bigch when all he's ever seen me like is when i'm nice , i could tell he was 

confused and i dropped it and left. i wonder how much time

it takes until i'll be so where nice and independent. i used to be so excited when i made like 

130 in tips , now it feels like so trash to me and like i'll have to stress

the rest of the week trying to make more.

 i haven't bought clothes for myself since march in spain. This isn't me complaining

i just want to tell you. i hope one day i really can make money and feel like i really

did something and i'm

not constantly feeling like the way i do or like i have to do things to prove to my 

parents i really am not that way. sometimes i get sad that your mom never wanted to meet

me but, maybe i wouldn't have liked to meet me either. 

i have a lot of scars on my legs now . i got a bikini wax for the first time the other day 

i was feeling really sad and crazy made an appoint

ent and was already On my way!. it was around carrollwood that's the first time i stopped in plantation.

it hurt rally bad and was lowkey awkward but wasn't at the same time. it hurt really bad. i want

to go to art school. Idk where maybe ringling ? i found it in sarasota. i think about you all the time.i 

wondered if you saw. hints of yourself in my final for art. yes i know it's ugly. i bought my camera for oh

photography class, i heard my professor is super super mean but i think i'll love it i have to develop all my

own film and make it in the dark room i can't even 

bring m phone in there.

i think about you all the time. you love so strongly and delicately i wish for a moment in my life

i could be like that. you are 

one of a kind only one of you ever.
