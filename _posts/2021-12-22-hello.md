## becki's second letter

okay ! i hope this works im no coder like you. merry christmas 🤍 i'm happy your home for christmas and doing well. sometimes i feel like that bored or no one to talk to but i resort to painting or drawing a lot. i reorganized my whole painting room but my room is such a mess i've been avoiding it for weeks. I didn't really get anything for christmas my brother bought himself stuff with my card on amazon and my mom has been bothering me for money for cuba for a really long time. i don't know if i ever told you but my moms
mom passed away a few months back from covid. but i gave her 300 and nobody is really getting me anything. Besides my mom helped get me this WACOM cintiq 16" drawing tablet yesterday and i've been trying to set it up all day.
I really hope one day i can see you doing exactly what you wanted to do and be happy in a career not feeling that empty feeling. I don't have anything else under the tree but i had to wrap every single one of my brothers gifts for him bc he doesn't know how. I probably won't do anything that day , sam and nuria for covid so none of my
family is seeing eachother either. My parents wants for go
to spain for march, i asked them to leave me behing because i don't really want to go anywhere. Sometimes that boy that lives w my parents friends texts me on what's app i never answer but the way he has texted me before reminds me
of you and it makes me like feel weird. But i just rather stay home and just work i feel like i don't want to go anywhere with my family as bad as it sounds. one day i'll go on a trip with
one person and feel happy , but for now i don't really want to go anywhere. i'm still on bc. i buy myself a lot of things when i'm upset so i've bought a few gifts for myself. everytime i go to blick, this art store by hcc but now i'm going to be going to ybor but be bought lots of canvases bigger than me. i just don't know what to paint exactly on them . my teacher for art asked me to be a a part of this show companies shoot where they have models wear shoes and a bunch of stuff but i told him i didn't want to show my face, and i wouldn't take a headshot. but that's still passed the holidays. I've hated working at my job recently idk why but i hate the restaurant feel more than ever and yesterday i closed with a new server i literally had 14 tables at once and was saying crazy stuff to that poor girl for like 3 hours cus i was losing it cus she wasn't cleaning her tables or anything. she would leave like 5 piles of all her tables plates by the register or just random spots instead of taking them back so i confronted her like 3 times i knew i had to chill but sometimes i get insane . I wish i can watch the spider man movie but i'm going to wait for it to come out on tv or something so i can watch it in my room. I'm excited to start my classes i feel like i actually have things i do and get to talk about things i like and listen to people teach me things. I haven't said this to anyone in so long , i just want to let you know i love you and i appreciate you for even thinking of me and caring to ask me things. I hope nothing ever happens to you and if anything ever happens to me i want you to always know that!! I wonder how your sister is doing. 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
