## i really hope youre seeing these
dear becki,

for some reason, i get the impression that you never look at this. i didnt bring all my letter writing supplies and things to write letters from home, so im going to wrtite it on here for the remained of break. ive been home for like 4 days now, i finished all my school work. i should end with all a's and two b's,
but i know that i can do better, and i need to do better for next semester. i dont think that im going to do anything really this break, maybe, if anything, ill go out 
or do something with eliecer. i spend my days here playing little computer games on my mac and stuff at home, but i think im going to watch some documentary or something,
partly because i feel like im rotting just day after day doing the same thing, i want to learn something. ive been thinking so long about that thing that happened to you at chilis, 
that made me so angry hearing that that happened to you when i first heard about it. 
also, i dont know if you know this, but your mom called me by accident the day i was leaving gainesville, im telling you this because my intuition tells me that your mom would be the type of person
to never tell you that, but, i could be wrong. she also left me a voicemail, but it was just random people talking. when she called, i completely froze, i thought something happened or something like that. 
also, something i forgot to ask you in my last letter, you need to tell me where you guys are going in march! if its to europe, that would be so good, i wish i could go to europe. i think,
as something to keep me busy, im going to learn how to code things into our website, like maybe little stickers or like just change the format of things. maybe one day,
you could open one of my letters, and see like a little animation, like a cat or a little frog or something walking around. next semester, im taking a class anyways that is going to teach me how to code,
so it will be good practice. also, you need to send me all the stuff you were going to send me. please dont think that like youre doing too much or something, i really want to be able to read all your stuff!
plus, if you send it to my house here, and it sends, then in gainesville ill get a po box so that hopefully youll be able to actually send me letters and stuff. christmas is almost here!
this is the first christmas where i dont think i really want anything, maybe im just getting old. maybe if i could buy myself anything, it would be little things 
to furnish my apartment. something thats a bit weird, is i always wonder if you still play animal crossing. if you do, you need to tell me about that, and send me pictures of your island!
anyways, its really late. i wonder if you remember what my voice sounds like, and if you read these letters in it, in your head. 

love, 

kevin fernandez
